# PyPEMA
PyPEMA is a Python implementation of the PEMA Toolbox originaly developed in MATLAB which implements the Principal Elementary Mode Analysis (PEMA) algorithm. This program was designed for Systems Biology applications with the purpose of determining the most significant metabolic pathways in a metabolic network in a fluxome dataset. PEMA operates by performing a data compression procedure similar to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the fluxome dataset but, instead of computing principal components, it uses the Elementary Modes (EM) as principal components to find which EM subset best capture the variance in the flux data. Further technical details may be found in the original PEMA paper published in the Molecular BioSystems Journal [1].

# Installation
PyPEMA is currently best used on a Python interactive console such as IPython. This way the PyPEMA project can be cloned or downloaded to a local machine and be used right away.
